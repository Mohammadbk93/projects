These are my projects:

## Data analysis
### [COVID_Pandas_Numpy](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/COVID%20Pandas%2C%20Numpy.ipynb)

## Blockchain

### [Sha256 & RSA](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/Project%20SHA256%20%26%20RSA-Copy1.ipynb)
In this project I used `sha256 and RSA`
This project involves the development of a Python program that combines two essential cryptographic functions: the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and the creation of digital signatures using the RSA algorithm. These cryptographic functions are vital for securing data and ensuring the integrity of digital information.

##Time_Series

### [TimeSeries_Forcasting](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/time_series_forecasting_in_tensorflow.Project.ipynb)
Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to develop and compare various deep learning models for time series forecasting using TensorFlow. The focus is on predicting future values of a dataset by training models on historical data and evaluating their performance based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### [ML and DL in MoCap](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/HAR_MotionCapture_Thesis.ipynb)
Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to develop a robust Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, such as LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and RandomForestClassifier, to improve motion recognition accuracy in sports, rehabilitation, and ergonomic settings. The system addresses key challenges, including feature extraction, data imbalance, noise in sensor data, and the integration of temporal and spatial features, with the goal of enhancing real-time performance and robustness in real-world applications.
