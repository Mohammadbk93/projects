### [Master's Thesis: ML and DL in MoCap](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/PPG_Signal_Processing.ipynb)
Project Aim:
The goal of this project was to develop an advanced Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using both traditional and deep learning models, with a focus on CNN-LSTM architecture. The system aimed to improve the accuracy and robustness of motion recognition in sports, rehabilitation, and ergonomics by addressing key challenges such as feature extraction, data imbalance, and noise in sensor data. Through the use of hybrid models like CNN-LSTM, the project successfully integrated temporal and spatial features, leading to significant performance improvements.

Results:
The CNN-LSTM model achieved a high accuracy of 94.78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in motion recognition tasks compared to traditional ML models. This approach significantly enhanced real-time motion recognition capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios involving diverse activities and sensor data.

## Blockchain

### [Sha256 & RSA](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/Project%20SHA256%20%26%20RSA-Copy1.ipynb)
In this project I used `sha256 and RSA`
This project involves the development of a Python program that combines two essential cryptographic functions: the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and the creation of digital signatures using the RSA algorithm. These cryptographic functions are vital for securing data and ensuring the integrity of digital information.

## Product Matching and Price Comparison
### [Product Matching and Price Comparison](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/Assignment_task%20(1).ipynb)

This project aims to streamline the process of detecting product overlaps between two datasets by combining **text similarity analysis** with **price comparison**.  
It is designed for scenarios such as e-commerce catalog cleaning, marketplace price monitoring, and duplicate product detection.

By comparing product names, brands, and prices, the system identifies items that are likely the same but may have **different listings or inconsistent prices**.

## Objective

- Match products from two sources based on name similarity
- Calculate and analyze price differences
- Visualize matches and pricing trends
- Export results for further review

## Key Steps

1. Clean and preprocess product names
2. Compute similarity scores (e.g., fuzzy matching)
3. Filter matches above a similarity threshold (e.g., 70%)
4. Calculate absolute price differences
5. Visualize results with histograms and bar charts
6. Export matched results to CSV

## Output

- `all_matched_price_diff.csv` â€“ full list of matched products with price differences
- Plots showing similarity and price distributions

This project was developed for an assignment involving product comparison and data analysis.
