## Blockchain

### [Sha256 & RSA](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/Project%20SHA256%20%26%20RSA-Copy1.ipynb)
In this project I used `sha256 and RSA`
This project involves the development of a Python program that combines two essential cryptographic functions: the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and the creation of digital signatures using the RSA algorithm. These cryptographic functions are vital for securing data and ensuring the integrity of digital information.

##Time_Series

### [TimeSeries_Forcasting](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/time_series_forecasting_in_tensorflow.Project.ipynb)
Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to develop and compare various deep learning models for time series forecasting using TensorFlow. The focus is on predicting future values of a dataset by training models on historical data and evaluating their performance based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### [ML and DL in MoCap](https://github.com/Mohammadbk93/projects/blob/main/HAR_MotionCapture_Thesis.ipynb)
Project Aim:
The goal of this project was to develop an advanced Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using both traditional and deep learning models, with a focus on CNN-LSTM architecture. The system aimed to improve the accuracy and robustness of motion recognition in sports, rehabilitation, and ergonomics by addressing key challenges such as feature extraction, data imbalance, and noise in sensor data. Through the use of hybrid models like CNN-LSTM, the project successfully integrated temporal and spatial features, leading to significant performance improvements.

Results:
The CNN-LSTM model achieved a high accuracy of 94.78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in motion recognition tasks compared to traditional ML models. This approach significantly enhanced real-time motion recognition capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios involving diverse activities and sensor data.
